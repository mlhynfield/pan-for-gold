# Panning for Gold

> Mathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio. The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as financial markets, in some cases based on dubious fits to data. The golden ratio appears in some patterns in nature, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other plant parts.

Two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.

This program compares the ratio of two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (e.g. 13/8) to determine how close to the golden ratio this position in the sequence comes.
